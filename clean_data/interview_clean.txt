




Q1  I am interested in learning about what you do for a living  Can you tell me a bit about that 



A.  Oversees budgetary personnel and program for MADD  a national nonprofit in Pacific Northwest that provides victim services   Yes    Well  I'm the my title  of course  but I the Pacific Northwest region  We have programs in Washington  Oregon  Idaho  Montana  and Alaska  I oversee those operations  you know budgetary personnel  and program for for mad  primary focus is on providing victims services to survivors and their families and loved ones that have been impacted by a DUI crash   
Yeah  just five months  
I am not  but I work with people that that provide those services  We have victims  service specialists and victim directors and managers in in all states  And do you or the organization work with children  Yes  If they're obviously impacted  but with parental consent  Typically it's a family that's been helped  That family has children  





B.  Executive Director   Washington nonprofit     Washington recovery alliance that org that correct  Yes  And we have your title as Executive Director  Washington recovery allowance  Washington recovery Alliance   I'm the executive director  So that's my role  But the organization essentially seeks to reduce stigma around behavioral health issues  really leaning heavily of substance use issues  because there's a gap in advocacy and understanding of substance use  but we also do it for mental health  because we know that substance use in some locations  many occasions causes mental health issues  and mental health issues can cause substance use  addiction  things like that  And so we also do co occurring disorders of both things  And also medical conditions  we know that substance use mental health that might also cause physical ailments  And so we do a lot of that  once again  is we want to educate the community as much as possible around these issues in order to decrease stigma  which stigma is extremely  you know  insidious  in when it's not blatant  but when it is blatant  it's also very difficult  And also  the other thing that we do is public policy  And so we do a bunch of advocacy  We do advocacy  in the way of education  but also in the way of loving so we do actually meet with legislators and we say  you know  here we are  we know you know  please listen to our stories  We know what we're talking about because we're going with gone through you know  the issues that we you would we would like for you to address with either a program or resources  And then yeah  so that's  we do we do a lot of lobbying  but most We do a lot of advocacy and public policy work as well  That is  what I do with you as my executive role is to make sure that the mission is accomplished  And we do have a small team in our organization  But that's I believe that's the answer to that question  
It is two years now 
We do not do that in the in  you know  in the way that you see  like their direct services  when it comes to treatment  we do not do any classes around recovery coaching or peer services  we do not  but we do meet with people  you know  in person to offer trainings  we call them our legislative advocacy trainings  we  we see this as a direct service  but it's not a clinical service 
No  




C.  Executive Director of the greater Spokane Substance Abuse Council (SSCAC) and the President of Washington Association For Substance Abuse And Violence Prevention  I have been at SSAC for 30 years  (Son was killed by a  17 time repeat drunk driver)  Started the Spokane County DUI victims panel  working with prosecutors  public defenders  judges  victims of impaired driving crashes  to put a face to impaired driving    I was on the Governor's Council on substance abuse  I had a fellowship with the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation that we started watsapp with  I just have always been someone who  who worked hard on public policy  and wanted to make change in education to affect substance misuse  and violence  Rather than locking people up and punishing people  I've always felt that it was about public policy and education 



D.  I oversee the substance use disorder prevention and mental health promotion services for the Health Care Authority  And so in our section  we have data projects  we have policy projects  including legislation  you know  in build review  like other state agencies  or CD MC does  We have statewide different projects such as public education campaigns that we run  statewide sir  We oversee contracts with different entities or universities for services that are administered throughout the state  And then we oversee  contract our section overseas  you know  folks on my team oversee contracts with local more local organizations to deliver local prevention  STD prevention services and mental health promotion services  And so we we do grants out and then we we administered those grants through the contracts  So type of work  I I have worked it  I've worked for the Division of Behavioral Health and recovery since December of 2002  2006 So what is that 15 and a half years  the Division of Behavioral Health and recovery was with the Department of Social and Health Services DSHS when we  when I first started with them  however  in 2018  the entire division  including myself  and my team moved over to the Health Care Authority  We don't provide direct services  Okay  I'm thinking of this question  And it may have two different meanings  So on one hand  if the question is  you know  who's kind of our primary constituents in terms of who we work with  we work with communities  we work with providers  and those providers of prevention services may be community based nonprofit organizations  We work with local schools and school districts  we also work with the educational service districts  and many of them deliver direct services and or are intermediaries to additional subcontractors that might fall within any of those categories  So the our main kind of point of contact out for services are those who we contract with to provide services and I frequently refer to them as providers  who they work with when they're providing those direct services  we call participants of our programs  And those would be a youth  you know  or children  That might be part of a prevention program  It could be young adults  we have some programs that are focused on the young adult population  It also  we have a number of programs that are parents of teens  youth children  And so it's working with the parents to help support them in supporting their youth for young adults  We do have some work that's happening  although it isn't the main body of our work for the older population  And then we also do work with our tribal partner  our tribal partners  the tribes do some prevention services  And so then they are part of our provider network  And they similarly have families that they work with in communities  they work with individuals 



E. Kitsap public health org     And is your title health communities specialist in the Chronic Disease Prevention Program for Kitsap public health   I manage the Olympic region  use cannabis and commercial tobacco prevention program  I am also through that that's a policy systems grant  So we work on substance use prevention policy  and local and statewide  and in a different role  I also sit on the Washington State Public Health Association  board of directors  So I kind of fall within that public health and substance use prevention and youth advocacy buckets that you mentioned    No  No  I guess my customers would be the leads of organizations that work directly with people with people in the UK     Sometimes  yes 



F.  I'd like to go on record that I'm not representing the views of HCA or DB HR  So and make that clear throughout the recording and the interview      My professional title is prevention system manager with the with the Division of Behavioral Health and recovery within the prevention section  within Health Care Authority  so System Manager  Again  I so one of the jobs I do I want to clarify for the record  one of the jobs that I do  as part of my job is I'm on the steering committee for the rural Prevention Network  which is a priority population contractor for the the Department of Health's youth cannabis prevention grant program  And so it's a little convoluted how I ended up over there  but but I do I am on the steering committee for that group  And that's how I found out about about this interview because our our coordinator  Christopher Belisle  would suggested folks to to rural Prevention Network members that  you know  this  our perspective might be valuable  So that's kind of the capacity in which I'm here today  I don't know if it's super critical to point all that up  But I want to at least make make note of that before we begin  I have been here for about two and a half years  But prior to that I worked for a year as provider for the same grant that I am now helping to manage  which is the community prevention and wellness initiative grant  So it's a it's also abbreviated as C PWI  So there's about 100  Community coalition's across the state of Washington funded to the tune of about $130 000 a year to help in there  They're focused on high needs communities  so they're  like  not every town can apply for a C PWI  Grant  But that's the that was the program I was working for for a year before I came to work at HCA  I don't do direct care direct service provider in my professional capacity  In my personal capacity  my wife has a nonprofit called the rural youth Alliance  which has just getting off the ground  it's brand new  And apparently  according to people who know these things  might be the first of its kind in the nation  which is kind of intimidating  But the rural youth Alliance is a is a rural LGBTQ plus youth support an advocacy agency group  nonprofit  So there are lots of LGBTQ youth support groups and agencies in the in the nation in the world  But most of them are centered in in large metro areas  This may be the first of its kind  specifically dedicated to rural neighborhoods and rural communities  So that's just getting off the ground  No  So but so I do some work there  We host drop in meetings  we have some advocacy that we do in schools  We're hoping to launch some education programs  So yeah  like I've got  I've got some for you 
JInformal  technical assistance only at this point  I'm not on the board or anything  But But yeah  like providing technical assistance  helping them write their strategic plan  write their grants  that kind of thing  But yeah  it's mostly my wife is on the board  though  So it's kind of hard not to be fully associated with them  So I'm the contract manager for nine c PWI communities  So in the north Puget Sound North Olympic Peninsula region  So I work with the communities of Port Angeles Quilcene Chimacum Port Townsend Oak Harbor  south would be Mount Vernon  Sidra Boolean concrete  So those nine communities all are I worked with their coordinator  but I also I have attended their coalition meetings  I've had some interaction with some of their sort of service recipients  if you will  like prevention clubs and teens  you know  who are working on prevention related activities  that kind of stuff  So So yeah  I mean  I'm  I'm  I'm in it  I mean  if you're going to break it all down to just a few key words or phrases  I'd really like to be represented as a youth rural youth advocate  Because  yeah  like  because  I mean  because that covers all the bases  That's what I do when I'm working at HCA  That's what I do when I'm helping  Helpful rural youth Alliance  I just it rural youth advocate like that's  you know  I used to be a student assistance navigator  I worked in Santa Fe High School for over a year  they're working with kids in crisis  but it was very strangely funded  So I had to get out of that  because it wasn't really paying the bills  But it was a great job  I was just  I was a science teacher before then  You know  I've done a lot of different things  But the one consistent thing all the way through that is advocating for our young people in the country and making sure that they have the best  all the things they need to stay healthy and have a good life  Okay 



G.  director of policy and legislative relations at the Washington State Department of Health  == I'm the  again  the Legislative Director at the Department of Health  So I am the main contact for legislators for all parts of the Department of Health  and it's a very broad public health portfolio  including  you know  our work around substance use behavioral health  and obviously  our key role is as in the COVID response  And then also  some of the other areas where we intersect quite a lot with liquor cannabis border  in restaurant regulations  and that was also a part that came up quite a lot during the COVID response in the early days when when restaurants were closed  In general  my  my role is  you know  advocating for the department's position with the legislature  you know  promoting our legislative agenda and  but also  you know  working to answer your questions that legislator have  and  you know  promoting public health at the  at the legislature   I've worked at the Department of Health was 9095  So what's that 27 years  I'm not a direct service provider  And I'm not a public health professional by education  I'm a political science major  I'm much more policy  analyst and background rather than a public health  egislators  I'm sure  They're the governor's office  policy folks there have them other agencies  legislative staff for sure 




H. President elect of the Washington State Public Health Association  Chair of Diversity  Equity and Inclusion committee  and then also senior public health policy and program advisor for the American Indian Health Commission  I'm a consultant  So that is a different type of status than an employee  so I just want to make that clear  I do not speak on behalf of the American Indian Health Commission  As an employee  I am a consultant Also  for Washington State Public Health Association    I am a volunteer on the board and part of the board  I serve as the president elect of the the Washington State Public Health Association    the statewide association that its membership is about  I think it's right about 500 public health professionals from across the state  And has been in existence since the 1930s  And you know  deals with education and policy  Those are the primary areas   I've been on the board since 2018    I'm sorry there I serve in a leadership capacity  their board member and President elect  So that's my capacity   And the American Indian Health Commission  I serve as an advisor in public health issues  The Commission is a nonprofit  tribal organization  that has membership from the 29 federally recognized tribes and 3 recognized tribal organizations   There again  My focus is on public health and which a large part of my work has been around the cannabis prevention  tobacco prevention that is focused on youth prevention and to some degree focused on pregnant people   No   I do provide Like trainings and workshops  but that's in whole groups  not a one on one direct service in any way  Yes     Yes 



Q2  Are public health impacts of alcohol consumption related to your day to day work 



A. yes  we work very closely with law enforcement and also in depending on the name of the agency in the state  for example  Washington State has the Washington State traffic commission  I am on an advisory council that looks at data that's collected for impaired driving both drunk and drugged driving in we look for ways to minimize those  either legislatively  or working with courts  We have court monitors  so that that data that that is collected  we don't monitor alcohol consumption  What we do is pay attention to DUI  and DUI fatalities and crashes  I'm sorry  go ahead 




B. Yes   We focus on reducing stigma around behavioral health issues  particularly substance abuse issues mental health addiction medical conditions and want to educate the community to decrease stigma  We also do public policy   advocacy   lobbying education  We actually meet with legislators   We provide legal advocacy trainings   We do have to keep up with statistics and data in order for us to be able to do the education and the advocacy we keep up with it but don t report it 



C. We are not a treatment center  We are prevention  So I lead a coalition a power coalition which is prevention  outreach  wellness  education and resources  And I do I have  we have like a Haida Grant High Intensity Drug trafficking area  where we do seminars and and workshops  We do the Spokane County DUI victims panel  we do a 24 hour jail alternative program  So we we do prevention services  but we are not direct services for treatment   Yes  thank you I serve on the Washington impaired driving Advisory Council and with the Washington Traffic Safety Commission  and I track all the data that comes out about traffic safety  I also track access to treatment and and have tracked like the increase in drug impaired driving versus alcohol impaired driving  High rates of Bac also worked on when I 502 was the initiative tried to through legislation  we stopped legislation to legalize marijuana but then also worked on that because it's often we have alcohol and marijuana mixed with impaired driving and also in need of treatment  Okay  thank you 




D. Let's see  not necessarily on the daily  So our section  our division agency is responsible for the administration of the Healthy Youth Survey  Have you heard about the Healthy Youth Survey yet  So I don't have to explain it  I just didn't want to like go down a whole road  If you're like  I got it  No  thank you  Yeah  yeah  So we're responsible for administering that we do that in partnership with the other agencies  So we're not like a you know  a sole on that  But I have a very significant role in that  In the Healthy Youth Survey that there are questions that are self you know  the students self report  their consumption of different substances  and the frequency of difference of substances and the environments and that sort of thing  We also are responsible for administering the young adult health survey  which includes information about consumption  Similarly  they have pretty similar questions in that regard  But not all things actually matter when gives you the wrong impression  So from that standpoint  those are kind of two of the big Okay  data collection that we have related to consumption  aside from that  again  not on a daily basis  but for instance  I get the reports that the LCB puts out on  you know  purchase  how much is purchased  We do have strategic planning processes  where we look at other sources of data  such as the National Household data is the we might look at purpose for different data around what are the different rates of use and consumption and work   Yeah  yeah  So  like  survey  Yeah  Yep  we do  And we also do that  in partnership with the Department of Health  Okay  And we also have a contractor who helps with the administration  and then analysis and stuff  so  We are part of the Yeah  I mean  not I don't directly  I'm sorry  I don't  so my team are responsible for that  And  and then I do actually sometimes do the presentations  But we do a lot  we do a lot more presentations on the data  And I do present them to do sometimes  um  didn't necessarily like additional reports on the data 




E. Not not necessarily alcohol consumption  but you know  alcohol as we focus on risk factors and protective factors for use    No  No  not in my job   Like I mentioned  people in substance use prevention and public health are not always addressing single substances like if you're referring to alcohol  we address it more by having a background in the risk factors for substance use and protective factors against substance use  So it's been sort of a broad training of all substance use 



F. Yeah  so mostly tracking the data  Not so much to hospitals and such my primary data sources is the Healthy Youth Survey  But I definitely track the Healthy Youth Survey  There's also an analysis that was done by the rural Prevention Network  compare like segregating the data from the healthiest survey into rural versus urban  And that and that information has been very helpful to my work  So I'm also concerned with health disparities and the Healthy Youth Survey  but but in other data sources as well  such as the young adult health survey or the or the COVID student survey that was published a couple of times  so yeah  yes  I would say I it's not so much I track it on an anecdotal like case by case basis  It's more quantitative  like  you know  system wide kind of keeping an eye on things 




G. No  what i i My role in that would be as if somebody had a question around what data does the Department of Health have  I would help them locate that data  So certainly aware that we would  we might be keeping track of that we would certainly  you know  we might have information there  And my role would be finding that information for someone who was asking or if we were going to be putting forward a policy proposal where we needed that  that information that data to support the our proposal  I will be working with our staff to help create a narrative or you know  a description of a problem and and proposed solution   I would  I might be depending on you know  what the question was  I would  we might have existing data  or we might have other access to other literature 



H.  No  not directly  not in the sense of am I identifying those individuals that have a substance use disorder and working with them now  No  I'm the kind of training that I do is around culturally relevant public health that is providing training to public health professionals  Agencies  Healthcare  in the healthcare industry  And tribes as well  And then the trainings with youth are really about prevention focus that are about leadership development  the effects of  Not as much not so much liquor or alcohol  But cannabis and Tobacco   Maybe I have in more sort of  you know  generalized the health status of American Indian Alaskan native people  That have been included in some type of a presentation  but it's not something that I'm tracking on a regular basis  Yeah  right  All right  that's we've finished  I've read material that comes to me from those that are  I think that where I see the the most significance I I've never been  Tended to do work that has having to do with alcohol consumption  so that's you know  Certainly  you know one thing either by serving and doing particular trainings or by  On behalf of any other organizations that I might be contracting with  But where there is some crossover is in terms of prevention work  particularly around youth  That the topic of cannabis  Has certainly then brought in the topic of alcohol consumption  Particularly with you  but my work has not  and it's that's been more in terms of communities  And  So community input and then also leadership  administrative and  Political leadership  Missing  The particular concerns around alcohol consumption 







Q3   Does your work specifically focus on priority populations 




A. Yes   we focus on educating youth under 21 on dangers of drunk and drugged driving



B. We are a recovery community organization   People in recovery either lead or govern the organization  Our population is everyone in the recovery movement and everyone in the recovery community   adverse childhood experiences is big and can really determine whether you might have a difficulty with SA when you are an adult   We offer services to populations that have been marginalize and highly impacted by COVID  Black community members   LatinX  people in rural communities 




C. No  it actually includes all     we have had a provincial Youth Council in the past we've been when school when the COVID shut down  Our youth engagement really took a hit but we we do not we have youth youth component but also that it's very broad based working with the entire community  We do have a Department of Commerce grant that is about engaging community and community safety  And working with law enforcement  which is really focused on the partners LGBTQ questioning to the people of color  I do a lot of work on equity  I served on the Spokane Valley City Council for four years and did a lot of work on bringing equity into local government and policies for statewide elected officials in in local government  So specifically here at SSCAC  we are really about equity and inclusion and reducing that stigma of treatment and recovery and really basing our work on community   



D. Yeah  sowe have we think about that in a couple different ways  Some of it in  as you mentioned  age base  so like youth and young adults  and then maybe a little outside of scope of what you're looking to  but like  in particular  when it comes to the work that we're doing around opioids  looking into older adult population  And then  as you mentioned  work with the tribes and Alaska  American Indian Alaskan Native population  we also do focused work to make sure that our services are accessible and inclusive of LGBTQ plus people that identify with that population  and and then we have a lot of focus that happens around the rural populations  which  you know  those are all kinds of different ways of thinking about where they need  maybe different populations of need  The last thing I'll say is  is that one of our main initiatives that we have for implementing community services through our what we call the community professional wellness initiative  And then we also have community based grants that we provide  both of those are done through a process of looking at where the highest risk is in the state  and prioritizing funding to those highest risk areas  And that's based on using administrative data out of the core data set  And using healthy use survey data to identify where there is the highest level of consumption happening  and where there's the highest levels of compounding consequence happening when we look across the state and then directing our efforts there  So that's a different way of looking at focusing the population 



E. Yes   The priority population
in my region are LGBTQ plus youth  tribal youth and rural youth 



F. I'm working directly  I would say Latina and Hispanic groups of folks and young people  that's something that I've had  I would say  a fairly frequent dealings with  I have interests and passion for all intersectionality issues  I would say I have a passing familiarity with the  with the needs of students who are differently abled  but I don't wouldn't call myself an expert in that regard  just enough to make my way through an IEP  you know  as a teacher  But yeah  I would say those are probably the area's I'm most comfortable with 



G. Not in my role  I don't have a direct service role  I mean  certainly  you know  one of our main goals is health equity and making sure that underserved historically underserved populations are are achieving health equity  and  you know  reaching potential with the social determinants of health which is  you know  one of our I'm main missions and one of the things that I'm always advocating for  but I don't do any direct  Okay 



H.  








Q4   Does your job focus on youth advocacy 



A. Yes 




B. We include children in our advocacy but we are not focusing on that specific population 




C. Yes



D. Yeah  sowe have we think about that in a couple different ways  Some of it in  as you mentioned  age base  so like youth and young adults  and then maybe a little outside of scope of what you're looking to  but like  in particular  when it comes to the work that we're doing around opioids  looking into older adult population  (copied from above question)



E. It is part of it  Yeah 



F.  I'm working directly  I would say Latina and Hispanic groups of folks and young people  that's something that I've had  I would say  a fairly frequent dealings with  I have interests and passion for all intersectionality issues 



G. I would say that's correct  Okay  public health advocacy to the extent that we are concerned about youth access to alcohol and other substances  Certainly  that's a piece of it  But that's not my direct role 



H.  JW  Underrepresented communities having to do with alcohol consumption or just just in general   Generally I my work is is largely on behalf of American Indian Alaskan native population  
 both  
 Yes  
Yes
not necessarily a specific focus  Again  it would be an area that I  Would be inclusive of in our more in our work with youth or in our just general work because it would be an area where there's  You know both use it or LGBTQ+ OK   



Q5   Are you a parent 




A. Yes



B.



C. Yes  (no children under 2 years of age)     I do want to say I have four grandchildren who are all under 21  Okay  thank you  And I did by surprise  have a child after I got married after the crash and my son Nate was born on Trevor's fifth birthday  No  So I do have two surviving children  I have two children  and four grandchildren  Okay  



D. I am not a parent 



E. Yes    Yes 



F. Not asked  no response   but he has teenage daughters and is a licensed foster parent



G. Boy children  They're not really children  They're men  They're 32 



H. I am     My children are adults  And so I have 4 








Q6   Before this interview  were you familiar with House Bill 1480 



A. Not aware of the bill     was aware that those privileges had been granted to businesses     alcohol  to go and pick up 



B. Yes I was  I knew there were extended privileges (curbside pickup and absolutely the home delivery) and we decided to focus on the priorities that we had and that we wanted to push forward  



C. Yes  Part of what I do in my work at SSCAC and with whatsapp is is we work legislation we work public policy with a lobbyist and with a committee  I lead the Committee during this time  the legislative committee  and and we are actually the ones who work to put the sunset of seven 120 23  In the bill  We fought hard tried to stop the bill because we did not feel that it was necessary to have these products be delivered it at curbside when there was not really good regulation on how that the alcohol was being sealed  There was a lot of discussion about sealing and sometimes  you know  it was just a piece of tape over the straw  And we had concerns about people consuming while driving 



D. I'm I am more familiar with the bill as part of a regular part of our our business  which is during session we review any bills that are related to substances coming through these this  this bill being one of the bills that was reviewed to our review process  And so that's mostly where my familiarity is around in my haven't tracked in detailed the resulting rules  necessarily 



E. Yes  I saw this bill when it in draft form prior to leaving the governor's office and helped contribute some safeguards for public health into the bill  So then I was able to follow along during the legislative process and participate in the rulemaking process afterwards  So I know a lot about it 



F. Yep  well  I know that a lot of the communities that I work with and the people that I interact with on a daily basis were concerned  they had some pretty serious concerns about the bill  I'd heard some anecdotal stories about cocktails to go and and just sort of the  the expansion of alcohol approved spaces Beyond Bars  You know  and folks  you know  general concerned about  you know  increase adult drinking during the pandemic  So  yeah  I just know  a lot of people were really concerned about it 



G. Um  before this interview  I  I guess I I knew that there have been changes allowed as a result of the emergency declaration  And that  you know  there were bills to codify certain pieces of those  How much I again paid attention to passage of 1480 during that legislative session was probably not much but what that also tells me is that are you know  we we analyze all bills  we would certainly be analyzing a bill that would increase potentially youth access at the same time balancing that against the you know  the economic benefits to the the licensees  but of course also the benefits to the public who were able to you know  not be crammed into small bars because they were able to access and alcohol and and having fun time and are still be spread out  Right  So that was a goal also in my mind of legislation  So I guess I You're just asking how much what I knew about the bill  Yeah  no  I mean  I  I knew about the bill  And I would also say that  you know  if my staff had been concerned about the bill  and  you know  had wanted to push back on the bill or express any concerns about the bill  I would have known more about it  And that is not the case  I  I would say today  because I didn't know that much about the bill  I think we probably did not have any concerns about it 



H. Yes  I'm familiar with it  I mean I don't know it inside and out  but I remember  That it allowed the for alcohol to be purchased  In ways that  Allowed for delivery  And and pick up  I didn't know like all of the breakdowns for the various different groups like you just went through  but I just knew more generally  




Q7   Before this interview  were you familiar with the alcohol privileges specifically extended during the COVID 19 pandemic 



A. Yes   A neighbor actually told me   I saw some delivery to their house 



B. I think I was aware of that  yes 



C.  Yes  in addition to the delivery  okay  thank you  



D. I don't think so  We were tracking when you mentioned in 2020  even before the bill  some of the privileges came into effect  And so we were tracking on that from the get go  So I'm not sure that I like it wasn't like I necessarily in my personal life notice something different than something else that's already kind of knew about it from work 




E. Yes   Did I notice a certain one   Um  not necessarily  I was kind of looking at the bill as a whole  You're also kind of I guess I do have a question  It seems like a lot of the questions that you have are  are related to the alcohol allowances  but there were also a lot of cannabis allowances  This interview not referring to the cannabis allowances   Okay  Okay  good  to know  Yeah  Yeah  So I guess on the alcohol side  then we as substance use prevention  were probably more concerned with the cocktails to go  but I was following all the provisions  Thanks for clarifying 




F. Oh  yeah  Yep  So just ordering something by home delivery  or curbside pickup  So that was kind of the major one that you know  you know  if you asked  you know  if you were in a bar  and you're like  can I take this  you know  giant  fruity Martini drink out onto the street  they would say  Hey  what are you doing  It's gonna stay in here  But now they're bringing it out to you  and you're driving away with it  So you know  it was pretty clear that there was some  some changes in the way alcohol is being served associated with the pandemic  because he couldn't go in the bar at all right  So it made sense from a certain perspective  but I  you know  I was also  you know  I tended to agree with folks who were concerned about it so 



G. Yes  I was  because I  you know  a big part of my job was working with a number of different agencies  as we were trying to implement  you know  the various stages of the governor's proclamations and and closings and openings  and and ensuring that  you know  the various businesses were actually in compliance  We're in regular median meetings  They're so certainly aware of the that allowances have been made  On a personal basis  sure  going to pick up cocktails or takeout  was  you know  is something that certainly was never allowed before    guess my perspective is that I assume it was helpful to help those small  some a lot of small businesses stay afloat through the period 




H. And I guess delivery and  And  It must have been curbside that I was familiar with    Yeah  I that's an area that I am certainly I don't know the numbers  That's not anything that I've really watched very closely  But I imagine that it would be significant  and I do imagine it significant for those  During the time that there was closure  Of restaurants and of you know  breweries and I imagine that was also a pretty substantial impact to those businesses   



Q8   Do you or your organization have a specific position on this legislation 



A. That we do not have   We don t take an official position and personally does not bother me   As long as people are abiding by the law and not selling to people under 21   I do have some concerns if it moves forward 



B. No  Like I mentioned  we focus a lot on our priorities  We do notice legislative or bills that are going on in the peripheral that we kind of have thoughts on  but we don t have a position   We   our board or committee that deals with these things really hasn t written anything down or has really had possession of this   I would say we have no statement but there s definitely the sentiment for sure 



C. Well  I worked for the greater Spokane Substance Abuse Council  But again  whatsapp is a membership based in a volunteer organization  And we took a very hard stand against this bill at watsapp  And SSCAC basically is against expansion of alcohol in any way  Because of the effect it has on our young people  the perception of harm has plummeted during this time  And so we have a Our organization has a stand about not wanting the expansion of alcohol through our public policy work 



D. Yeah  exactly  That's  like  I'm trying to see exactly if I can speak totally on top of that  So yes  I think that is true  We those are all the things that are in in the list of the things that we're worried about is you know  additional access  drinking and driving  we know that there were some things that were put in place around like  Okay  well  where it has to be in proximity to the drunk driver  And  you know  the more access you have  the more availability you have  the more norming you have  which is also part of what happened around this is much more just community norming  For consumption  those are the kinds of things I think the drinking and driving the way that some of the initial implementation happened in terms of the packaging of like  well  it's basically a cup with tape over the thing and that was considered sealed  and it's like  is it so I think those were some of the things that were concerning to us  And maybe they have lasting impact  right  like the norming pieces  They don't necessarily go away the minute the rules changes  or changes  Those were concerns for us  That came up as the even pre bill  the things that were concerning for us that we were worried about as an organization  And as a person  these things worry me  In terms of the exact bill  I I can't speak to whether or not the agency has a position on the bill  Okay  but these were the concerns we raised currently  Yes  thank you  Yep  



E. No   No  my organization does not   So I was following this bill in an education only capacity  So I am not able to state a position on the bill  But I am able to was able to refer to prevention science that then data that I could bring to decision makers in an education only capacity 



F. My organization  you'd have to talk to somebody besides myself  So I can't speak for DB HR  or the prevention section or Health Care Authority  I believe there are positions that can be that can be had  but I would refer you to I think you're already in communication with Sonia PAETEC  She can get you in touch with whoever has our agency position  I mean  my position is that I would like everyone who is thinking about making this proposal to consider all of the unintended consequences that may occur as a result of it  You know  I  as a state employee  I'm hesitant to  to  you know  even if I'm off the clock  and I'm hesitant to well  more than hesitant  I can't advocate for or against any piece of legislation  But I can sure help people understand what could possibly occur if something were to continue or what already has occurred in some cases  So mine is really more about an education standpoint than it is about opposing or in favor of 



G. I assume that we were neutral  we we were neutral on the bill 



H. No  Yeah and I would just say on behalf of myself  this has not been an area of priority for any of the organizations that I've been involved with  so I don't know that they've taken a position 
Not for the temporary extension of an allowance  For these  although I do have to say that maybe I'm prejudice against the idea of premixed cocktails and cocktail kits  And you know  I  I think about the  I remember legislation from a long time ago that they removed  like fortified wines from certain areas  And you know  I just remember the some of the concerns and discussions during that time  and that must have been in the 90s  And so in you know  and that certainly had a lot to do with  you know  certain populations that are substance  And  Let's see certain populations that are accessing the stores that would be in  perhaps in in the main  You know  convenience stores  that kind of thing  Than perhaps having you know access to high concentrations of  Of alcohol in that are in certain types of liquor  wine in particular  Anyway  I just remember the  you know some of the issues around that I don't remember the specifics honestly  but it just made me think about that idea of having premixed cocktails and cocktail kits and what's the difference between spirits and  And where would those fortified wines fit into any of these categories  And for those populations of people that we know are already troubled by the use of alcohol  And so I guess that's something that has come through crossed my mind  you know  Again  I have not  you know  studied this  but it is something that I have  I have certainly thought about     In terms of the law as it stands  no  I no  Nothing additional  






Q9   In your opinion  what are the primary arguments of those supporting the extension of alcohol privileges 



A. It would be that businesses are still being impacted by COVID  We re seeing another surge in COVID cases and I think that continues to affect commerce   And that might be for the near future  or maybe this is the way of life   I m not sure at this point   That would be the only argument I could think of in support of   It continues to help  especially  small businesses stay afloat 




B. It is  you know  revenue  I believe revenue based  so that s probably as much as I will say about that   I believe that the people that support this are very interested in making sure these businesses stay in business



C. their argument was  is it that they were hurt so badly by being shut down  and that they did not want to have to serve food  There was arguments around you had to have food to serve some of this and you could offer alcohol during all these  I'm not sure how it ended up in the bill  I would have pulled the bill out of my book and looked at it But there were  they were saying they shouldn't have to serve food with it  There were they were talking about that it's convenient that people could come and get it that it would be sealed so that nobody would be able to use it while they were driving  They were checking IDs to make sure that youth weren't getting access  But I think those were the basic arguments  And they were saying  you know  the hospitality industry was very strong  strong lobbyists  strong advocates  just saying that they would not survive if they couldn't sell this alcohol  that it was a wave  and if they weren't going to be serving food in their restaurant  that they could pivot and increase their alcohol sales  Is that what you're asking me 




D. What I have heard is  well  I've heard the argument about  you know  part of what's in the bill  you know  how to keep these businesses afloat  I have also heard some folks say maybe there isn't as much of an impact as what people were worried about  Or just generally  people don't necessarily agree that the research that we're using to say these things are relevant  they may or may not describe to that  or believe in that  So I think those are kind of the counterbalances  whereas we're worried about access  availability  we're worried about how does this impact different populations to the bipoc populations  Is there a major increase in diversity  What are the products  What is the promotion  How does it impact youth  And then the a population that I mentioned earlier  and then I think we were particularly worried during COVID  because was  especially in the beginning  some of the unfortunate longing that was happening was really around lots of drinking  You may have seen yourself  you know  lots of social media  you know  I'm using some air quotes  but like the mom wine  and  you know  lots of just stuff that really was increasing vocalization about people using a lot more especially early in the pandemic  And so  you know  from our perspective  it's like that can have resounding long term impacts for some people  Right  And so I think that's  that's some of what our worry was  And then the other piece around these added I want to say flexibility that's out there called privileges  privileges  Yeah  thank you these added privileges is that the way they're written up  enforcement becomes a really difficult thing  So we were really  one of the concerns that we brought up is the they're not  It makes enforcement of things like drinking and driving or enforcement of open container law  Like all that stuff got a lot more complicated for enforcement  And when we don't  we're not able to have good quality enforcement  Again  you're shifting norms  Right  And so  oh  and potentially creating dangerous situations  So I think that was one of the things that we were worried about  too  and but just isn't  isn'ta concern for folks that want this to happen 



E. I think it's definitely economic  I  I do believe that they have seen quite a bit of economic benefit to having these privileges and and see them  you know  not necessarily as something to make do in the meantime  but something that could be really beneficial to normal service going forward 



F. Well  at this point  I can't really see what the advantages other than just the expansion of sale If it does lead to and again  this is the primary arguments of those supporting the extension  So yeah  I mean  I guess I guess the other I guess the only the only real obvious one is that if if somebody is still super nervous about about contracting  the Coronavirus that leads to COVID  And they would M but they would like to support local businesses  There is some argument to be made I suppose that they are able to support their business without exposing themselves to to risks but especially in in rural areas  I mean  the pandemic has been over for them for a while now like they don't there you can either some towns here in  in both Western and Eastern Washington you go to you won't spot a mask all day long  You can drive around and walk around as much as you want  You'll never see a single mask  It's done right there  They have moved on  So I really doubt from it  In the same rural areas where extending these privileges would have a detrimental effect on the on youth access  I feel like the positive effect of like  of maybe providing some so  so again  you know  like it's that same urban versus rural discrepancy in an urban area  you still got a lot of folks who are very concerned about the pandemic and and their potential Coronavirus  exposure  So they would look at an extension of this as a benefit because it could allow them to continue to support a local business without having to return to the establishment and go into the building  In rural areas  I don't see that benefit at all  I don't feel like the folks who would like to go to the bar can't I think they are and are quite happy to  But it also gives an avenue you know  it has all the negative benefits without the positives  So I hope that does that make sense  My 



G. In the probably the primary arguments would be that you know  liquor cannabis board's regulatory structure has always sort of appeared a little archaic to me and inconsistent and not necessarily logical  And I think that this during the emergency  there was just some recognition that maybe there were places where there's an overly regulatory stance being made without perhaps real strong evidence and in for the need 



H. Opportunity for increased revenue I imagine beyond COVID so I could see that being you know  an argument that convenience people have gotten used to home delivery and you know  And so just as you know  people have gotten used to working from home  so I can see that as being an argument for it coming from those that would support that  




Q10   In your opinion  what are the primary arguments of those in opposition to this legislation 




A. It would be that alcohol is already readily available   There may be incidences where the establishments that sell alcoholic beverages   I m not sure they are being held accountable   Like bartenders   for over serving customers     who is monitoring that   Is that something that s enforced like it is in a bar   In the state of Washington you can buy liquor  distilled liquor  in the grocery stores   So it is not inconvenient  at least in this state  for people to access alcohol of any kind   So the ability to have it brought to your house or you know  pick up     certainly it s an added convenience  but we re seeing   according to our data   a tremendous increase in the number of DUI fatalities in our state right now   I don t think this legislation helps much 



B. Increased accessibility is definitely something that triggers the recovery of people in recovery   Increased accessibility is really a huge trigger to relapse 



C. Was that there wasn't going to be good regulation  And we felt that it was like the camel poking its nose into the tent that this we would never get this reversed once that happened  And I think that is definitely the direction this is going is that the LCP is going to want to make this permanent  that the LCB is in the  in the business of selling alcohol  marijuana  and or supporting those who sell alcohol  marijuana  And so were our concern was this is going to be permanent  that there would not be good regulation on who is is getting access to the alcohol because somebody 21 could pull up  get the alcohol and have have teenagers in the car  We also thought it would increase impaired driving  because the people would be able to access the alcohol when they received it  And the other thing is  is that people were buying alcohol taken at home  and then going back out to buy more alcohol or pick up alcohol  And so impaired driving rates are at an all time high fatality we've lost 20 years of prevention and reduction of impaired driving fatalities  And  and that was our fear 



D.



E. Well  first  first  that there's really low compliance  We have seen  especially in some other states in Washington as well  that compliance rates adhering to these policies are close to the 50%  Mark  And for that  that is concerning for  you know  driving under the influence as well as youth possession of substances  public drinking  and just increasing the number of alcohol outlets comm has all sorts of public health harms to a community 



F. Well  primary arguments and these  this goes back to my rural advocacy aspect  Pretty much everything you're going to going to run into when it comes to problems and in in unintended consequences with just about every legislative policy decision or option or whatever is going to change when you're talking about the country or you know  rural places  rural remote places  So the same kinds of problems that that might occur in a city may be worse in the urban country  urban or rural areas  there might be better  they might be opposite  you know  there could be an inverse effect  depending on what the situation is  And I think the biggest thing with rural spaces when it comes to this kind of legislation is ID checks  So this this legislation  and in order to do it safely  I think the really a really critical component is checking identification of whoever's ordering  or picking up the  the  the cocktail or the beer  or the wine or whatever  In a rural places  ID checks I mean  like  you can ask anybody who's tried to do like compliance checks at a  at a rural grocery store or  or  you know  convenience store or something  it's 100%  Like  there is just absolutely no chance that a clerk is ever going to check  or is not going to check the ID of a strange kid who comes in and asks to buy beer  every single clerk of every single  I mean  maybe not every single but it's it's really  really uncommon that you're that a compliance check procedure that would catch some some folks who are not doing all the right things in in a urban or suburban setting  In a small town where everybody knows everybody else  it just  it just never  they never do that they don't sell to minors  What they do sell to is folks they know or kids they know  especially if they know that kid is sort of acting as an adult  So I'm going to pause there in case I've said anything that you want to know more about  but I have more to add  Did I raise any questions for you  Okay  cool  So yeah  yeah  I appreciate you kind of wrapping things up for me  because I did tend to ramble  I think about this stuff a lot  So  you know  feel free to cut me off if I'm getting off track  But  but the main thing that I want to get to that affects this legislation  and it's a rural value  that  that I think a lot of legislators and decision makers and policy makers etc  tend to overlook or  or  or under estimate  is the rural concept of  of assigned adulthood  So  us as the state can't tell a small town and their citizens when a kid is an adult  they decide when they're an adult  you know  there's no  this whole 21 is  you know  suddenly your grown up enough to do this or that or the other  They don't really respect that as much as folks in in the city and suburbs do  Because there are a lot more responsibilities in the country for younger people  They're driving earlier  Often  you know  there's there's exceptions to the to the license  you know  driver's license requirements  If it's a farm vehicle  for instance  like you can drive a truck from within your family's property or even a certain distance on on some country roads  because at an earlier age  because they have to  there's nobody else who can do it and and kids are happy to do it  they want to do it  they want to grow up  you know  ask any kid that's the first thing they want to do  So  things like driving or getting a job or you know  earning money or you know  getting job skills or dropping out of school if necessary  All these things these happen at any age  Mote usually earlier but most importantly  at the age in which the community and the family decide  not at the age that the state decides So  so I think just through the  you know  enforcement of  of cultural norms  and like really making sure it was understood  I think we had a pretty good boundary when it came to bars  So bars are 21 Plus space  And I think most communities have wrapped their head around that  and they're okay with it  But  but when when you start to break that boundary down and start doing things like home delivery of cocktails  or beer  or wine or whatever  or picking stuff up at the curb side  you start to erode some of that understanding already  I mean  I think when it comes to youth substance use  especially the biggest issue  that country that that rural places face is alcohol use  and underage alcohol use specifically  And it's specifically the community laws and norms around alcohol use  those are already in bad shape in the country  I mean  community laws  norms  things like that  when you're talking about like  alcohol consumption policies  that local festivals  you know  making sure that you actually have a beer garden  as opposed to  you know  just allowing people to carry their solo cups wherever they want  across the whole festival  I've worked in a town  there's a town  I won't name that where their official giveaway item that they give to people  when you buy a ticket to their big town  yearly  you know  festival is a solo cup with the  with the festivals logo on it  So like  I mean  there  we're already talking about laws and norms that are not conducive to keeping kids from using alcohol  And  and there's a lot of kids you can talk to in the country and say  when do you first when do you get your first sip of beer or wine or whatever  mostly beer  but when they'll tell you it was that it was at the local fair  or the local  you know  festival of some kind  So  so those kinds of things are very  already  you know  those those kinds of norms are already stretched to the really thin to the breaking point in some cases  So  legislation like this  even if it's not intended as a  as a relaxation of some of those norms  I think it has a disproportionate impact in in rural communities  if you can find  you know  and I used to think that  you know  we wouldn't really see a problem with delivery in remote areas  but with the  with the ease of something like DoorDash  or UberEATS  or whatever  where kids  you know  anybody can just download an app  and there's probably somebody in town who's driving for that  for that outfit  because it's something they don't need to get a special license for anything  they just sign up for the app  and then boom  they're  they're in business  and they're earning a little extra cash  It just makes it a lot easier for some of those walls between adult and and youth use to start eroding in and coming down  Gotcha  Could you list them again  just so that I'm clear as to which ones you're talking about  

Okay  yeah  so this is an easy one for me  for rural communities  specifically  the most impactful  one of those allowances is allowing third party delivery services such as Uber Eats  or DoorDash  or  you know  or even like third party grocery delivery  because like  it's pretty clear like those  those third party delivery services are not going anywhere  people are using them  regardless of their applicability to  to the  to the pandemic  So they're not using them because they started using them because of the pandemic  But now they're just using them because it's easy  You just pick up your phone  you tap a couple things  boop  boop  boop  and then 20 minutes  30 minutes  half an hour  you know  40 minutes later  you got your stuff at the door  you didn't have to go anywhere  you didn't have to pull out your credit card  or whatever  And it's just super easy  So those are pretty ubiquitous  and they're there in the smallest towns  you could possibly imagine  I would not have guessed that DoorDash would be able to worm its way into towns with population of 1000 people  but sure enough  there they are  And they're doing pretty good business  So sorry  So the so that that particular aspect  I think of has the most  in my opinion  has the most  the greatest potential for increasing the  the likelihood that youth could  could end up with alcohol that they weren't supposed to have  basically  cuz you've already paid for it  it shows up at your door  the driver isn't necessarily trained to card people they're supposed to  they have like a whole  you know  you can put all the regulations you want in place to make sure that they do their job  But they just drove you know  however long  especially again  this gets exacerbated in the rural areas  they just drove super long distance to get to this place  There's a fairly large  you know  there's gas to get there  there's a fairly large fee for them waiting for them  And  and it's maybe a big sale  and there's these kids  and they asked for the beer or whatever  And you're like  you know what I know their parents  their parents are cool with it  You know  I'll see him at Sunday on Sunday at church  I'll make sure they didn't get too out of control  Hey  you guys  just keep it down  Don't let the sheriff find out about all this  And then  you know  quick handshake and out you go  So it's a different  it's a different calculation  It's a different kind of transaction and  and spirit in which the  in which that sort of thing can occur  And I and I feel like that just has a much  much higher percent chance of  of  of becoming an access point for young people in the country  As opposed to urban environments  urban environments  your you know  there could be a totally different allowance  That's that's becoming a bigger problem  




G. I assume that they are concerned that it could increase use access to alcohol or increase substance use  or substance abuse  And  you know  certainly during this pandemic  we've seen the behavioral health impacts of uncertainty and isolation and concern that increased access to alcohol and other substances  I'm sure that there's been an increase in substance abuse  But I  again  I don't necessarily think it's because of the and this is my personal opinion  The I don't think that increased abuse is could be necessarily tied to the access of  you know  premix cocktails being able to be picked up 



H. Probably and again I I don't know the statistics  but  I don't know is it a benefit to make alcohol so accessible in terms of the concerns that we do have for substance  Issues substance abuse issues  I guess that would be an argument on that on that side  you know  I guess I'm just thinking about access again to  Maybe for access  For youth  Maybe in an issue that  From a prevention standpoint that this would provide  you know it certainly easier access for youth if there's  You know  again  potential for all of these systems  I don't know who's enforcing and monitoring these systems and structures for delivery or so  I guess that could be one of the areas is like who's who's monitoring that we're making certain that these aren't getting into the hands of underaged youth 




Q11   Would you prefer that the HB 1480 privileges remain  expire  or the Bill be modified 



A. I would say modified but obviously without knowing the details of modification   I wouldn t be against some of the provisions currently   Modifications   For example  right now  if you go and pickup alcohol  and it is in a sealed container     Is it sitting on the seat next to them or in their cup holder   You know  or did they put it in the trunk and out of the reach of the driver   Those are the things that are too loose in this situation   I think the modifications might be that  People could continue     they could have home delivery and that might help me to understand or be supportive of a modified legislative approach 



B. No  That it absolutely expires   As I mentioned before  it s definitely triggering to the recovery of people in recovery and we really want to prevent as many things as possible when people are recovering   We  want to keep people in recovery and we work so much to have recovery support services and this would sort of be the opposite of that  We want to make sure that there are communities that are ready to keep people in recovery  Everyone is educated on these issues so we prevent relapses and the more accessibility  the more visibility of alcohol everywhere  and I would say its sort of an indirect message that you know it s ok to treat alcohol in this way and to have it circulate in a way that it s so easy to access   Very difficult for people to stay in recovery with a community and an environment with this type of approach   So yes  I would love for it to expire and go back to decrease that accessibility 



C. I think they should expire if we are full back in in  in restaurants are open  I think that curbside delivery and and takeout of alcohol is a disaster waiting to happen 



D. I would prefer for them to expire Why there are  if we think about that  there is a legal market for adults to get alcohol  right  in a variety of ways  When we think about the balance between 
that would just  you know  I mean  that's true  And the potential harm by having these type of privileges expanded for longer periods of time  which  again  normalizing  adding access points  adding availability for youth  And we know those are three main factors that risk factors that contribute to the potential for us to start using  or are using alcohol drinking alcohol  We also know that when youth start using at earlier ages and use more frequently  they're more likely to develop a  you know  alcohol use disorder later in life  So use it start using before the age of 15  are five times more likely to develop use disorder later in life  So the longer we can delay onset by not having easy access by not norming as much in adult and youth populations  by being able to mitigate against those risks  and have less of those risks to risk factors in use lives  we basically are preventing onset of use disorder in more people  And unfortunately  use disorders have a lot of other compounding impacts in terms of overall well  wellness for the individual  but health safety for the individual health safety for the family  and those people that are involved most directly  but also kind of our overall communities and our community health and our societal framework in terms of well being  but also in terms of social economics  like  you know  employment and housing and those sorts of things  So it's one of those things where the more we can do to prevent it early on  and unless we have building the overall better health for individuals  and the society  And so as I think about it  there are opportunities already  We don't need more that might lead to more use disorders  which are not 



E. I  again  this is not positioned by my organization  but I would prefer that the allowed that the privileges expire 




F. So  as lifelong rural advocate  I would prefer that whole thing expire so that we just go back to the way it was 



G. Um  I would say that I think they could stay  And why  Because I  again  my personal opinion  and I don't have data to back this up  But my sense is that the SIR  the loosening of those regulations has not been a cause of a tremendous amount of new alcohol abuse 



H. I would say that there needs to be  you know  a review of the impact  Of this legislation  That is  you know  certainly we have to look at  you know  The impact on sales and  And also on our substance use rates  I am also having to do with youth and I know you said that you're doing some of some focus groups  I would also  I think it would be important  at least from my perspective  with a focus on prevention  and youth is finding out about how this has impacted the access  For youth   
Well  and I don't know to how you're designing focus groups  but at least if there is  I would say that the legislation needs to be modified  but it would be good to have data regarding not only you know the revenue impact  but also information about  Youth access to alcohol as a result of this legislation  And the alcohol use rates and to better understand if there's any correlation 



Q12  What do you expect if the privileges become permanent in the State of Washington 



A. I think it appears that these numbers continue to climb  In the first part of the pandemic we saw a decrease and it was mainly because people weren t driving  everything was shut down   As things continued to open up  we ve seen a steady increase   I suspect we ll continue to see that increase in the number of DUI fatalities   There is a trend  you know   we have enough data now for two years that indicate that is it probably not going to decrease 



B. The narrative  the feeling  the environment would remain     as one that communicates that it is OK to have alcohol in a way that is extremely easy     you can get it delivered to you  It really decreases the impact that alcohol has there s also the stigma that we have about people with addiction  so I believe that there would be a huge impact not only in public opinion and public understanding in the public   Comfortability around alcohol and accessing alcohol while putting children and youth in danger   because even though I m sure there s a lot or regulations around delivery of alcohol and curbside  I believe that also increases you know   the impact we see on children and youth    And that s a really big factor fo children to grow up with a SU issue when they become adults   So not only would we see an impact for the people who are in recovery at the moment and the people that are trying to get into recovery but also in the children and youth    a really never ending cycle of SUD   We are in an epidemic mental health  also opioid  but also SU   We have a mult substance issue   huge issue in the state of Washington    so I see the impact as Titanic   just one that we don t see and really don t believe    We really think the impact will be substantial 




C.



D. And the potential harm by having these type of privileges expanded for longer periods of time  which  again  normalizing  adding access points  adding availability for youth  And we know those are three main factors that risk factors that contribute to the potential for us to start using  or are using alcohol drinking alcohol  We also know that when youth start using at earlier ages and use more frequently  they're more likely to develop a  you know  alcohol use disorder later in life  So use it start using before the age of 15  are five times more likely to develop use disorder later in life  So the longer we can delay onset by not having easy access by not norming as much in adult and youth populations  by being able to mitigate against those risks  and have less of those risks to risk factors in use lives  we basically are preventing onset of use disorder in more people  And unfortunately  use disorders have a lot of other compounding impacts in terms of overall well  wellness for the individual  but health safety for the individual health safety for the family  and those people that are involved most directly  but also kind of our overall communities and our community health and our societal framework in terms of well being  but also in terms of social economics  like  you know  employment and housing and those sorts of things  So it's one of those things where the more we can do to prevent it early on  and unless we have building the overall better health for individuals  and the society  And so as I think about it  there are opportunities already  We don't need more that might lead to more use disorders  which are not 






E. So my expectation  you know  if this is codified  as you know  permanent  would be that there is some way to better the compliance rates 



F. What do I expect  Yes  I mean  I just expect to a  an even greater disparity between between urban and  and rural youth when it comes to alcohol use  I mean  the I think the one thing that's really clear  or has been clear to people who are paying attention is that  you know  while cannabis use is the primary issue for urban youth  especially LGBTQ plus youth  but also other other groups of youth  but and youth in general  cannabis is sort of the big problem and cannabis in vaping  and vaping  of cannabis  and THC products  but in the country  in urban  and we're  you know  rural and remote places  It's alcohol always has been  always will be  And a policy like this is just if you know if that becomes permanent  we're talking about even greater disparity in in the use of alcohol use rates  I mean  that's just that's just what it's gonna come down to  And you know  the negative health outcomes of alcohol  Kids in the country are much more likely to get in a car with somebody who's been drinking  they're much more likely to drive after drinking themselves  They're much more likely well 



G. I  I expect that those businesses who have enjoyed clientele that are expecting that service will be able to continue it   I would also add that you know  there are a lot of folks who are concerned still about COVID  And even though the restrictions are gone  COVID is not completely gone  And so  you know  being able to still take part in some of the recreational enjoyment  I think  for folks who might be at higher risk is something that is still to think about an advantage to the policy 



H. Well  it would definitely have an impact on those  Those businesses that are you know  it's not only alcohol that they're serving  So I don't know  I mean  I think that it would  you know during the pandemic it's it's a little bit different because of not having options to access Places  You know  was you know definitely a factor  so I'm not certain what I anticipate in terms of revenue  OK  because I don't think it would be the same under because of the circumstances  Yeah  I don't  I don't know  I think it would be more mixed  You know in terms of where you're getting your revenue  If it's from these as a result of these changes or not  and  I don't know if people are actually studying that  but  Let's see  Experience food services  What is so does is cannabis involved in as part of this legislationNo  OK  and so that would be a concern too  because if there were cannabis add being added to the mix  Uh huh  I think that that would be of concern for me  
Well  I I  I certainly think that  There's some things that if parts of this were permanent  I think I I see it is a potential really a good thing  I guess I I'm  I'm not really  No  I I feel like I should have read it in detail before having this conversation with you  because what I'm thinking about is this idea of  you know  many bottles wine drinks things that are premixed and small amounts of that  That is a really different type of category than having  You know a the larger quantities that you would get from a  You know a winery or or even breweries  The way that it's structured right now  Is that you can order cocktails for delivery like to my house  If I wanted a you know I don't know martini or something  You could actually order a martini and it would be delivered  So those are the cocktail kit  
OK  Yeah  I think it would be really good to  Understand the data about this you know and also I don't know what who  what data is being collected  Who's ordering these  You know who's using these services and what kinds of things are they  Are they ordering   OK  Yeah  I don't know if that type of information is collected  It must be  except for there  I'm sure that you know it's like well people  Adults over 21 years of age  Yet  Yeah  I I don't know  I  you know  I can understand it from a A  From places that focus on  Providing you know  take out  Or delivery of meals  I suppose  Yeah  I don't know that I have a  Decision about about this  so it's yeah   ell  I I guess that the you know the UM  The comment about the data is that I'm not certain what all the impacts are  It would be nice to know  You know  but and then I don't know if you know where we can where that information would be had  Is there an impact to underage drinking you know  Is there  You know our alcohol consumption rates  I imagine during the pandemic they've gone up  And So what does that mean  If we're looking at extending this this legislation to a later date  You know  I you know  and 








Q13  How do you define a healthy community 



A. it's pretty broad    I think healthy Community obviously is one that looks at Health issues  Both you know holistically and and by that both you know physical and mental   That all decisions that are made are are should be in the interest of the majority of your of your citizenry or inclusive of all citizens not majority that those are  Public health  mental health   those services are provided   In in my perfect world  they would be provided for free   But that doesn't exist that I know of anywhere in our United States   And I believe that there is good public education and notification  So people are aware using different mediums to that  That the average citizen can easily access that information and  is supplied with that  information  For  for example  during the pandemic  I don't think that people ever wondered where can I get tested for COVID and where can I get vaccinated  I think our state governments and federal governments did a very good job of getting that word out  and that's just one example of how we can ensure that people that do need health services     they don't have to look very far  



B.   Yeah  absolutely  that's what I was mentioning earlier in the  earlier section  is that  You know our communities need to absolutely have a clear understanding of the the impacts of alcohol  but also and so that's what I mean by by a Community that is healthy is not to have people not use  And obviously we are really preventing the use  but substance use is a medical condition  and so if we do have people in our community that are that have a substance use disorder  that's still we still Can have a community that is healthy by providing support to the to people with substance use disorders  Some people  and that's part of the stigma might think  Oh my goodness  no  We have people that have addictions that must  not mean that we don't have a community that is healthy and I disagree  We have people that might be sick just like we have people that have cancer and diabetes  We also have people that have substance use disorder and So what to me means once again  to have a community that is healthy is to have an understanding and caring and full of resources     Outreach and prevention  where we also where we're helping  people with substance use disorder as we help other people get healthy and and so also really importantly  And this is I'll mention  this is where our our community  our organization stands    we absolutely want to keep people in recovery  We think that that is the biggest investment  Until treatment  there's a lot of people that focus a lot on treatment  Treatment is very expensive and there's a lot of treatment out there  We do need to get better about accessibility of treatment  and you know  culturally  appropriate treatment  but there's a lot of focus on treatment  but What it does is that really educates people of how important recovery support services are like having a Community that is healthy in the way that it provides  Resources and provides recovery support services like housing  employment  transportation and education  Things of the sort  and definitely to have a community that is very once again very well understanding of these issues and that it reduces the stigma  And I believe that community that is healthy would be a community that does not  increase the trigger of people when they get when they get sick  when they have a medical  condition  A brain treatable  Condition the way substance use disorder is so a community that is healthy would not have this legislation and that is not a statement from my employer  That's my statement  



C. A defined a healthy community is access to health care for everyone  And that precautions are taken to protect everyone in the community from disease and unhealthy behaviors  And that and that the norm is is that substance misuse is or substance use disorder is on is on the same level or parody with medical issues  And yeah  I mean  that's taking some notes  Okay  I mean  I could I could talk all day about I mean  it's 




D. I'm trying to think about      one of the things that worries me is half of this might impact different communities and communities of color or how it impacts different earlier I mentioned LGBTQ plus populations  And so we already know there's a disparity with those populations  So my worry if this continues is do we continue to see more significant disparities with those populations   I think the only other thing    and it may be wrapped into kind of my general consequences pieces   but this piece around serious injuries or fatalities related to impaired driving 




E. I define a healthy community where everybody has the opportunity to have access to health and access to you know  prevention of harm in their community  I guess that's the  that's a broad definition of how I see Community Health  Yeah  so you know  speaking  I just think that trying to stay really broad  So access to like  everybody has a right to not be harmed in their community  And if this includes you are more likely to drive under the influence community or in your community  because getting cocktails to go in their car  for example  then that  you know that that's somebody losing access to not being harmed  And that is not fair to them  But of course  there are a lot of other social conditions that are not necessarily related to this  just from public health 



F. Okay  a couple of sentences  A place where everyone has a fair and equal chance to live the life they want to lead  Start a family if they want to succeed at their  at fulfilling their dreams  and they don't  and they feel like they don't have to move away in order to make that happen  That's one of my personal sort of tragedies is seeing kids in in rural areas feel like they have to leave town or to succeed or  or to have a good life  because there's just nothing left for them there  You know  I think that's I think that's really sad  Especially considering  you know  how many opportunities there are sometimes in places like that  But there's also a lot of mental health and substance use disorder issues  and all kinds of other things  complicating things  But yeah  just that everybody's got a fair and equal shot to succeed  and they don't feel like they don't have to leave in order to  



G. Where people  all people in the community are  can reach their full potential and are living happy and healthy lives 



H. How do I define the health community  So  Well  one that has  A healthy community is one that has housing and access to healthy foods and good clean water and  Access to to green space and places to  Enjoy themselves and play and And has  You know families that are supported moms and babies that are supported in healthy ways  Systems that provide care  Without racial bias or prejudice on  I could go on  Do you want me to   I would also just say commercial tobacco free and  Where kids are protected  



Q14  What kinds of social conditions contribute to the health of a community 




A. Ah boy  I think inclusiveness  openness  the ability of anyone social conditioning conditions   Say  rates of social issues  such as crime or unemployment that kind of thing   I was thinking and trying to figure out how I was going to articulate that   So we re faced with all of those issues  the increase in crime and the violence  The use of high power  All of our social issues are tied together  You know there s one that s separated  When I was speaking about the increase in crime and violence  I think all communities  large and small  are seeing this and it s becoming  you know  we already have a divisive nation  We re just actually making it worse   The health of the communities  you know  socially   It is kind of vital to our existence 



B. Oh my goodness  there has been so much discussion and but you know  research  But the the one that really jumps out the one that I have seen in my own personal experience that I've heard people in recovery say is one of the most helpful things to keeping myself in recovery  Two very important things  It is a peer support services and also housing  



C. So the number one thing I believe  that affects health is poverty  As  as we have people who are either on subsidized health care and not  not being able to access a them me think of how I want to say this  I want  I want to talk about the number of people I know who go to the ER  rather than being able to go to a family physician or a specialist  when we have insurance when we have good health care  and that's what we're used to  we go to the dentist  we go to the doctor  we do things that help us keep healthy  but when someone is living in poverty and doesn't have access to health care  I also think that in schools that are in areas of poverty  that when when kids are coming to school sick  because there is no option for daycare because their parents don't have anyone to take them that we see our kids in the low income areas are not as healthy  



D. I define a healthy community as a community where there are opportunities  access for individual well being  That leads to community societal well being  So when I think about that  I think about things like positive community norms  I think about families that have good family management  that are able to  you know  not as things come up  the family knows how to grapple with that and manage through that in positive ways  And in a population based social conditions population base  Oh  okay  So we're talking about things like then I take it out of the family  family  individual context  Um  so I think about things like  minimal promotion of  of well  I guess  in this case  alcohol  So  you know  the less amount of times that the US in particular  but I also think of adults and people that are in recovery are getting exposed to and have in their face alcohol advertising or promotion of alcohol or promotion of drinking  the availability of it so that there is less availability of  again  sorry  I usually think lots of substances  So alcohol is about a healthy community overall  So it can be well  then it could be any substances  Yeah  So  you know  I think about the different advertising that happens around all substances  And the same with alcohol and the different mediums by which people are being reached out to  So overall  I think about less promotion  I think about safe routes  which means there isn't  you know  there's less impaired driving  I think about less promotion  and that the community laws and norms are around aren't favorable towards substances  right  So that students  well  sorry  students  I'm thinking a survey right now  But the youth understand that there's risks and that the adults in their life care about them  And that they  there's risks with using substances that adults in their lives care about them  and that those adults also don't think it's okay for youth to use substances 



E. Affordable housing is really  I think green space is really important 



F. Housing is a big one  It's one that  you know  is popping up a lot more lately  especially in rural areas  I know that there's a lot of press given to urban housing situations  but a lot of the urban housing is exacerbated by people leaving the country who can't find a place to live out there  You know  like  rural homelessness doesn't look like urban homelessness  So they don't the people pretend like it doesn't exist  but it really does  And it's pretty bad  You know  it could mean living in an RV that's doesn't move and has no running water or electricity  that it's like somebody's you know  the back of their field or something  but it's still homelessness by my book  And  yeah  I would say housing is a big one  But social emotional learning  and  and just the  like  the expertise of schools to understand that  that  whether they like it or not  that is part of their job  Rural Schools have are real uncomfortable with their role as social emotional support systems  They think that should be the parents job or  you know  mental health professionals or the churches or somebody somebody else should do that  But really  there isn't anybody else left sometimes to do it in schools kind of need to take take on that role  job skills education  like vocational training  that's that's in there too  But I'd say it's not as critical because usually if you take care of given places people places to live and making sure they have good emotional regulation  so they don't blow up their boss or  or blow off work too much  and they get fired  Like they can  they can figure it out when they get if they can get to a job and keep it then they'll they'll be okay  But yeah  I would say housing and emotional regulation  not just for youth either  but for adults  like helping men especially manage their anger  and manage their  their emotional state being able to express themselves  That's a really important thing 



G. Absolutely  You know  there's all sorts of  again  social determinants of health that are impacting negatively and positively people's health  I'm about you know  just some of those determinants might be the socioeconomic  certainly the environmental justice  any kind of particular environmental impacts of a person's direct environment  certainly  sort of the historical inequities that we've seen on populations and various sort of inequitable regulatory structures that have impacted people 




H. Condition of the community well condition is based upon what I just said that moms and  Babies and families and families are supported 



Q15  In your opinion  which of the social conditions that you just mentioned are the most important to the community's overall health 



A. I think mental and physical health   and safety  obviously  You know the basic human need that people need to feel safe in their communities   How we get there is the bigger question   But I think people are not feeling safe and I don t think people are feeling especially heard  and I think every community could do a better job of being more inclusive to the diversity that surrounds us all 



B. I'm sorry just say peer support  peer recovery support services  OK that's right  And then housing as well  Recovery Support services might be the most  important because you have that person throughout your journey helping you get into housing and so and helping you getting to education  helping you  you know  Continue to keep your recovery  So I would say peer recovery support services that are everywhere in hospitals   They're in community centers  They're in courts there  in recovery cafes  They're everywhere  so peer recovery support services  whereas housing is extremely important  Peers can be everywhere and they can help you get into houses  



C. There are certain neighborhoods  we know based on data that like in our east central Community  which has a a high percentage of the African American or black population living there  their health  their life expectancy is 12 years less than someone living just a few miles away in a more affluent community  So I think that poverty plays a big role  I think community norms plays a big role  As far as like  if the norm is  like in many of our neighborhoods  there are alcohol outlets  there are marijuana outlets  there are convenience stores  there's food deserts  and that affects the health of the community  As well as does safety in our neighborhoods  So I think it's it's the poverty  community norms  and I think also marketing by the alcohol  And I guess I'll just talk alcohol  I think it's marijuana too  We're  we're bombarded with marijuana  billboards  and alcohol  billboards  and the norm around those messaging like around Gonzaga University  and they have alcohol ads  about you know  goes eggs  Same with all the colleges having alcohol messaging  They're the sponsor of the Eastern Washington football team  And so it's messaging  So am I off track  Or I am I don't  I think I think that's it like in our in our work in prevention  Early on  I went to the state legislature and advocated for school breakfast  and school lunch and expanding the lunch programs because we know kids can't learn they can't  then they can't succeed  They can't stay in school if they're hungry  and they can't even function  So I think I think I've said what I think affects the health of the community 



D. Yes  I think economics plays into the health of the community  You might be thinking  why are you pausing  Yeah  So yes  I do think economics plays into it  I think  in my mind  I think having diversity within a community helps contribute to the health of a community  And having equity in a community is something that is part of having overall health and a community  Having access  access to employment  access to housing  access to services  when services are needed access to food that is healthy  And access to health care is one of the services think all of those type of things play into  you know  overall wraparound of the totality of the health of the community access to recreation  outdoor space  I think making sure that communities have fair and equitable access for people that have different levels of ability  whether that's cognitive or physical  Making sure that that that can happen  I also think transportation is a key piece of a healthy community  and that the community has the transportation needs that they  you know  have what they need regarding transportation  And that can be pretty different depending on  you know  where you're at  if you're on San Juan  part of that is ferries  if you're in  you know  Tico  you don't need a ferry  but you need other sorts of transportation opportunities  So I think those are some of the bigger context pieces  Is that help a little  or is that  Maybe this is kind of a cop out  because I think it impacts all of these  which is that piece around how do we create communities that have equity in them to those different  different pieces  and  you know  whether it's employment  housing  economic  I mean  that comes with employment sometimes  But you know  that economic piece  but I do think a big piece of Healthy Communities comes in around the availability of resources and services that allow family is and individuals to do what they need to do  even when tough stuff comes up  Okay  I think so I think part of it is  is when I think about a healthy community in a  in a in real life  It's how can the community respond to the adversity at faces and have access to the resources it needs to respond to that adversity  which is different than thinking about  in my best case  wishful world  the absence of adversity  Okay  so it's kind of like a realistic view versus a dream view  I don't know which view you want  But in the dream view  it would be a community that doesn't have any of those adversities 



E. I think that's a really hard question  since these are all intertwined  and asking to pick one is really hard  Yeah  I guess I can't really pick one 



F.  You really want me to narrow it down  don't you  Honestly  I think it's a social emotional support and learning like general mental health promotion  Just because  you know  housing is critical  but I've noticed that when When people are in a good headspace and can like make plans and follow through with them  they'll figure their housing out somehow  may take them a while  but they'll  you know  they'll they'll figure it out  But when you're  when you when you're on a hair trigger and just blowing up at anybody in anything that moves and you get in fights and  you know  using a lot of unhealthy coping mechanisms  and you get locked up through domestic violence and all these other things  then then nothing else is gonna work for you  you can provide all the other supports you want  But that's the one that kind of gets in the way of everything  And it's connected to alcohol use  So especially for the purposes of interview  I would pick general  like mental health promotion supports and awareness and education 



G. No  I think poverty if I mean  to me  that's the big one  Yes Um  I think  you know  opportunity  equal opportunity is critical  And the opportunity again  that's for income and education and the opportunity to have a clean and safe environment 






H. OK  can you go through the list again and I'll tell you  
Yes 

  
Yes  
Yes
 Yes  

No  









Q15 (continued)  Do you think the extension of those privileges by HB 1480 could affect any of the conditions for a healthy community you previously mentioned  If so  which allowances would have the most significant impact  and how 




A. I think the delivery of alcohol   the curbside pickup is one area that I think could strongly affect the health of the community   The inability of law enforcement or people to be held accountable for those activities    especially to go drinks like I said earlier  That very much concerns me 



B. Yeah  you know to be quite honest  I just think that all of them all  every single one of them bring its own nuances and  you know  impacts very negative impacts  Once again  in the form  of accessibility in the form of triggering in the form of the  change of the public opinion of how easy it is or how easy it is to get these things  how accessible they are visible   They are  you know  the outdoor one  They're visible  They're accessible  and so when all of those things happen   they're triggering  but also once again  they're easy to to get to  They're easy to see  They're easy to to to be a part of the of the of our community that I believe is not healthy now  This all of them would be very impactful to to the recovery community but also to the people in the journey to recovery  



C. Even the people that are not in their journey to recovery  They might  They're getting once again like you were mentioning just the landscape  this community and it is sending the message that you know alcohol is able to be present and visible and accessible  and so when you're dealing with a substance use disorder issue   That that is a very interesting  That is a very impactful sort of message to get  So all of these things that you're talking about  would be the most impactful  Every single one of them have specific things or they have similar things that would be really negatively impactful to  people with lived experience  You know of recovery or people that are that have living experience  They're either in the road to recovery or they haven't even thought about it   They're still have a substance  use disorder  and they're not  really thinking about   Probably there they're still in the midst of this condition  So I think definitely the home delivery  delivery and third party delivery definitely affect the health because that way  if someone is you know whether it's an adult at home  just requesting more alcohol  I think that the more access you have  the more you will use  I think that is a is one I think selling the growlers selling the cocktails  Just the norm it sets you know  there's a There's been  I think  one beer deliver delivery service here in Spokane region  And they're all over the radio  they're all over everywhere  you know  we'll bring it to you  And  and you don't even have to leave your house  And I look at that  And I think  okay  if children are living in  in homes where there is excessive drinking  or there's drink  I mean  I'm not against drinking  let me tell you that I'm against impaired  impaired driving with drinking  and I'm against children being affected by anyone's use  whether it's a parent  grandparent or anyone and and we have so many kids who are the norm is that they drink because they have good access  we just haven't stopped parents from saying  Hey  I'd rather have a drink at home  then then go out and about  and we've had about eight teens die this last year in alcohol involved crashes in our region  So I think selling those cocktails to go selling anything that delivers it to the house  whether I know that the carriers have to check ID and all that  But that's just the person at the door  So I think those are probably the most and the outdoors service  What taught remind me what your meaning about the outdoor service 




D. I do think it will impact those different things  For all the reasons that I said before  because in part  these things contribute to access and contribute to I mean  in a generic sense  what we were just talking about some of the adversities that communities face I think the higher level of potency going out the door  so to speak  of the product  I think as their delivery of spirit  Yeah  Yeah  So for instance  delivery of spirits or the cocktails to go  I think that because  generally speaking  if you know  that has the potential to have somebody immediately end up with a greater impact if  for instance  they're driving  they're driving under the influence  they may have ingested more and have more of an impact there  I think delivery is one in particular  that is concerning  because of the lack of ability for law enforcement to keep up with I mean  I'm not against law enforcement  I'm not talking ill of law enforcement  But  you know  how does how to how is ID being verified  Is it pretty easy for you to have 121 year old and the whole house full of minors  You know  are these third party deliveries really checking IDs  And how would enforcement ever keep up with that  And so I think that feels like one of the tougher parts where access points where there could be a lot more diversion  If you  you know  you have your question of like  what is more worrisome curbside and takeout  You know  you have a retailer already who has certain regulations around who can provide it  and it checks and it is a physical location  So while enforcement is still really challenging  it's there  There are some systems already set up for that this is just offering yet another access point  And another thing for law enforcement to have to monitor  I think the other piece about the cocktails to go is just the containers  It it's easy to open and reseal it  And so how do you maintain that something somebody isn't either using it while driving and or the diversion factor as well  So I think those are some of the things that these allowances  add complexities  and also add vulnerability points where access becomes easier  in particular for us 




E. So I  so I really think that this is one of these specific privileges  And add to that  you know  everybody has a right to not be financially harmed in their community  That  although all sorts of factors included in there  so No  there's more  they're more likely to they're more likely to use substances more likely to have access for substances  So does that go back to access to health care and access to you know  housing and all of that  Not necessarily  I don't what



F.



G. I think in my mind  sort of the delivery directly to homes is probably the  the riskiest  I think outdoor service is what I would say is the most beneficial in terms of allowing most people to enjoy safely enjoy a social situation  Again  I  I would say that  in terms of the concern with youth access  that I think we would have  and that I have the delivery to home was probably the most concerning 



 
       So  Probably the other areas are of more of a concern for me  but I'm thinking about  Take out and growlers  You know one of the things that I've been  you know  just thinking about is the alcohol that is recommended  A level of quantity of alcohol recommended for Men and women to maintain healthy lifestyles Is a pretty limited amount  And particularly as you know  As people get  you know  beyond your youthful years  I guess  And so I just I just wonder  you know about  The just the concept of Growler growler  I'm not even certain what the quantity is in a growler  Can you tell me  Do you know the answer to that  
        Ohh yeah  well  I also just think about  You know the  So I'm not certain about how the you know who's monitoring how it's monitored  but I just think about  you know access  How much trouble is it to go in  And so growler for delivery here  right   Growlers to go   Oh growlers to go  I'm gonna take that off my list    OK








Q16  Does your work involve the use of health statistics 




A. Yes   Data of impaired driving     which is broken down into a lot of detail based on type and age of vehicle being driven   It really becomes very detailed information  but primarily on those fatalities and crashed 



B. Yes it is  You know we do use it once again to educate and to do advocacy  It is not  Yeah yeah I will  I will  that is  that is my answer is yes we we have to be on the know how of youth statistics  



C. We use the Healthy Youth Survey  Okay  And you know about the Healthy Youth Survey  I'm sure we do  Yes  Okay  good  And we use that because a lot of our work and a lot of our communication is about youth  And  and that is about sharing what affects our youth  And there's a couple of really good things out of there that I always include in presentations about the perception of does the adult in your in do the adults care in your community if you're drinking  and  and that's really eye opening to adults when they hear that kind of statistic  but also the fact that our kids are not exercising as much  I had a school based mentor boy for five years  And over the five years that I had Alvin  it was a lunch buddy program  over the five years that I was with him  We went from being able to play kickball and baseball out on the recess playground  to not hurt we could kick a ball  but you couldn't kick it where it might hit somebody  They wouldn't let them play football anymore  We could shoot baskets  but we couldn't really play a hard game on the you know  like  like the little boys they love to play like they're playing hoop fest  And so I think that that those kinds of statistics about our kids having activity being able to be outside being able to get their energy out and then he had school problems because they they didn't get enough of their energy out at the recess and then they'd make them come in and sit in the classroom of course after lunch and and a 15 minute recess  and they couldn't do it  He couldn't do it  So I know I'm kind of off track on that  But I'm just saying I look at the statistics that affect our health of our community  and I see you know  I just see that there is a lot of impact on movement  eating healthy  And  and just just the effects of like  the other thing that is affected I think everything about health is the political fight over vaccinations and masks  And that is extremely hard in my community  because there is a real faction about it's taken our rights away to have to mask up or get a vaccination  Okay  thank you 




D. But can you confirm that that's correct  That you use health statistics  Thank you 



E. Yes  My specific role that I'm in does include gathering that data  but I'm not like  epidemiologist that's not my position is partnering with those types of data people 



F. Yeah  so we use the core data set from from RDA at the Department of Social Health Services  it's the word dataset is like the core actually stands for something I can't remember what exactly but like community outcomes  something or other  but it it factors in a whole bunch of things  So like referrals to  you know  public support  like housing assistance  or  you know  free lunches  that kind of stuff  So there's some poverty indicators in there  There's some hospital data  there's  yeah  yeah  I would say I  I'm not as familiar with all of those as I am with the Healthy Youth Survey  But yeah 



G. Yeah  I  you know  I  again  I help people access them  I use health statistics  In our  my role  as you know  know  supporting our various policy interventions  We identify public health problems using health statistics  and then using various other evidence based proposals  we would make suggestions to state law to  you know  help address what we see in the health statistics  So in that way  but I'm not a person who is collecting health statistics or analyzing health statistics in any way  m  we would probably I would talk maybe on this context around the bird First sort of the behavioral Yes  health questionnaire  Yeah  And then we also have a healthy Healthy Youth Survey 



H. Yes  Yes  So  I use the overall health status  Of American Indians  Alaska natives on primarily  but also compared to other populations in  you know  the levels of chronic disease and where there may be  Disparities certainly looking at issues relative  Again  I do not focus on alcohol  but  The liver disease and  Is something that would you know   I would be aware of and also  The use of substances overall and commercial tobacco

C.



D. I think over time also  again  I would suggest that it would
      either maintain or decrease  I don't think it would increase it by having it expire  because then they'd go away  I don't think it would have no effect because retaining it has an effect  But I'm not sure that we would see a decrease and wouldn't have a decrease like happen overnight  So I don't know

C.



D. I don't know 



E. Decrease



F. I don't have as much of an understanding of the connection to crime  as I do  just general use statistics  but I do know there is a correlation so I'd expect crime rate to decrease as well 



G. I don't expect to change

Q24  In your opinion  are there any positive impacts of the extensions of alcohol privileges  Please explain 



A. The only positive impact is outdoor dining  I think that has become quite popular  and it helps   It has helped those businesses stay afloat and they continue to offer outdoor dining in areas that you never used to see  I think that s a positive 




B.   No positive impact no  



C.



D. This is really interesting for me to say but I don't really know  It's just conjecture  So I feel like I probably shouldn't  I can't think of like any isolated positives  No  I can't think of any 




E. I speaking with my public health Hat    No 



F.  I mean  the for for my focus  population area  just being rural communities  I don't see the positive impacts at all  I don't really for rural communities and rural  If if the beneficiaries of the of the allowances were rural alcohol  retailers  like restaurants and bars  if those were the ones who benefited from these allowances in the first place  I mean  of course  you know  removing all age restrictions  and you know  there's allowances that would definitely increase their sales by significant amounts  But overall  here's the thing  it's within its within their best interests to have a safe and healthy population  That's something I think the alcohol  retail industry doesn't really always understand that  that an addicted or or severely negatively affected populace is not going to be a good customer base  So in my  in your Yeah  So to get back to it  Yeah  I don't think there's any benefit  No 



G. I think that there are a couple of positive impacts one for those businesses and also to continue to allow people to be enjoy social use of alcohol and as in a more spaced out  environment 




H. Well  The revenue  OK  so that's anything that's a positive impact  The revenue and access to those that are wanting to have immediate access  With everything else  No







Q25  In your opinion  are there any negative impacts of the extensions of alcohol privileges  Please explain 




A. I think I ve listed those before   The ability to sell alcohol  pickup delivery and seal it in a container     there are just too many variables there to what is responsible service and accountability for over serving customers 



B. You know  we yes  like I said   it's just unsurmountable  we really are dealing with a a very  big issue that we we do not see how  how  how the dominoes will fall and they will fall really  really hard  It's going to be a really bad situation  It's once again it's  It's a small issue to some people  but to us that see the really big impact we are working with  the Community will believe it  It will be pretty impactful  One of the things that I didn't mention Is that we have a workforce shortage in the state of Washington  behavioral  health  healthcare  healthcare as a whole  and so with you know people you know going  going back to drugs  I'm sorry  Going back to the substances to alcohol that might really increase the need for more services  And right now we have an absolute behavioral health system that is just really struggling because of a workforce  The issue and so you know with the increase of necessity for treatment  because people are really being triggered into relapse by this this law or by this extension  I'm sorry  not the essential by By this allowances we're really going to continue to see a huge strain on the behavioral health system and and we really can't have that  We already  Once again it's struggling to even serve the people with  you know with substance and opioids and mental health difficulties  Even you know  physical difficulties as well  Like I said  healthcare as a whole  so this is really going to put a strain and it's really going to impact the services that other people will need  And like I said  because there's a workforce issue  we're seeing that a lot of people are on wait list to be seen for services physical or you know that are  urgency  Substance use is that extreme  Urgency  addiction  mental health difficulties are an urgency   And people can't be on a wait list  That's not right  There's a lot of risk to keep people waiting to see someone for substance for a behavior health issue  including and specifically an addiction  The way that alcohol is  and so once again  this extension would really want  Like I mentioned  it's so triggering so visible its so present it could really trigger the recovery  People going getting into and and going back to drugs  having a relapse  and then really  Once again  flooding the behavioral health system that is at the brink of a big issue  So that's one thing I did not mention  but I'd like to include  



C.



D. I think one thing that I haven't stated explicitly  but the the overall cost to the state  For if people if there is an increase in use disorders  the overall social and economic impact in the state and the the loss of economics due to you know  like unemployment and stuff  but also the loss of the productivity  and then the cost for services to  you know  to help treat people and  and provide recovery support services  or those people that end up in situations where they're unemployed and unhoused  And need those services  those services are cost the state money  And so there is this other consequence of what is the balance of the economics  And I think there is a consequence to that 



E. negative impacts Yeah  yes  So we know that in in states that have looser alcohol regulations  there is higher incidence for driving fatalities  domestic disputes  and like youth fatalities due to driving under the influence  Youth use of alcohol  And so a lot extending these allowances expecially if we maintain this level of like not Um  compliance  I think could have really detrimental impacts on public health 



F.



G. I don't think there are  I don't think so  No 



H. Yeah  and I in my opinion  however  not a very  Studied opinion because I don't know what all of the factors are in the data  but I would suspect  And  That by  The extending this then also just creates more opportunity for access of youth under age  Access to alcohol 







Q26  Do you think the health consequences of the extension of alcohol privileges are considered by the people in Washington State 




A. I think so  yes




B. No  no  absolutely not  And one thing that I'm  I'm sorry I didn't mention  Also  I can't believe I didn't mention but one  One thing is that you know we notice from the statistics that Latino that next and the black people have been one of the most impacted people by COVID in regards to relapses and so  not only does the community do  you know  not know about the impact that this will have  But we will continue to Compound and add to the  You know issues that we were already seeing in these communities  and so not only there's  There's many reasons why these communities are the most impacted  and they're the ones that are relapsing the most is because they were already dealing with a lot of the you know  social determinants of health that they don't have  access to  and so there it's really difficult to attain recovery and stay in recovery  And so and so I what I was mentioning is that  We continue to have this this legislation  We continue to compound on these very already  We already it  It's not that COVID and this legislation you know is doing all of the the negative impact work that we're seeing is that we are really compounding on a big issue already  And so to answer your second question  no we we've gone through many events  many things that have told us that the community is not really ready and to understand the impacts of you know or or really there's a lot of stigma still in the community  



C.



D. Like the general public  Yes  No  not really  Not in maths 



E. I don't think so  I don't think the general consensus is that  But I do think sorry  I do think that  you know  people don't want to see use drinking  So I do think they think that  but I don't think they're thinking of health impacts  I really think  Yeah  the knowledge is not there 



F. Yeah  I don't know  I mean  it depends  I don't like to generalize a whole group of people  I would say the majority of them are not really considering them  I mean  if you look at  you know  the amount of wine memes they share on Facebook  I mean  I don't really think they care 



G. Some certainly  I think just the or are you thinking like  DUI or alcohol  the health impacts of alcoholism     Okay  I guess I guess  I would say both of those things  if people were concerned  that's what they would say  are concerned about and use access 



H. I think  Just generally  I doubt that a lot of people  Are I don't know I  I guess generally I just don't think that people are paying attention to it  but except for those that are would have a revenue impact  And  So those businesses that would be impacted  I would imagine that  If at all it would be the concern about youth access and the level of alcoholism  In our in our state and how this extension would impact those that data 







Q27  Do you think that the extension of alcohol privileges impact certain communities of people over others  for example  youth  elderly  rural vs  urban  etc  



A.




B. Yes  definitely this issue that we're talking about once again it it  it would impact them  especially when we know that you know neighborhoods and communities where  predominantly Latino or the black community are  There's a lot of those  There's a lot of visibility  There's a lot of those stores  There's a lot of you know  There's nearness to access to to alcohol  and so to make it even more  you know that's already  once again  that's why we see a  lot of these difficulties is because they're so close to them  They're so visible they're so present they're so there's such is access  The ease of access that  while not only do you already make it extremely easy for them to access this because they're riding the neighborhood s targeting these communities as vulnerable communities  but then all of these extensions and expansions and  allowances  and at the curbside pickup delivery all of that once again comes to  compound is just an additional impact  And yes  we we talk a lot about youth  Youth is extremely vulnerable  especially youth of color  LGBTQ youth  and And and and so yes  youth Latinos  and also the black community  I believe that are going to be continued to be the most impacted  



C.



D. I do   No  I think I covered it earlier  



E. Yeah  I think  I think use it is highly impacted  but also can like lower income communities  or even rural communities where there is especially low compliance rates  And I think that they are probably more likely to be out of compliance and serving alcohol to go to youth and really  in adults drinking more and binge drinking  especially more is not healthy for them either  So I would say rural communities impacting hard  and like low income communities of color specifically  do tend to have higher incidence of domestic disputes when there are more alcohol outlets available  more ways to access alcohol  So I think that those communities are impacted by these policies as well 



F. Oh  probably  but I  you know  I'm  I'm hesitant to speak to any of those because I have less expertise about them  But I'd say if I'm going to go on the record  I would limit it to rural  but really  any  anybody who is also at risk for alcohol use disorder  or early initiation of alcohol use is at higher risk  So underage people  or people who are coping with a generalized depression or anxiety  people who are subjected to some sort of marginalization in the first place like LGBTQ youth and adults Yeah  Um  I mean  I would say the other  the other  rural definitely  and then other marginalized groups that are also highly susceptible to alcohol use disorder  So or early initiation of alcohol use 



G. Um  I would think that if there are populations who have felt like they've been  you know  alcohol has been a part of historical trauma  like  tribes    I was I was saying that there could be tribal populations  if they are  have felt that they've experienced trauma in the past with alcohol  historically   I  I mean  I think there are probably other populations that might be concerned 

 Um  well  I'm sure there are groups  you know  Mothers Against Drunk drivers  other folks who may have you know  had family people who have been injured in the UI accidents and  and populations who have just felt the impacts of alcohol don't want to say that those don't exist  In in all of my other answers  where I said  I don't think there'll be an impact  Sorry 



H. Yeah  I know I'm not certain no  OK 









Q28  Since the pandemic's beginning  delivery apps like DoorDash  UberEATS  GoPuff  and Drizly have become popular  Have you ever heard of these apps 



A. Yes   From family  friends  neighbors  and I ve used them myself   I have never used one of these apps to purchase alcohol 
B. Yes  I use them and other family and friends use them  




C.



D. Yes
just existing    They're all over the place 



E. Yes   I have used the apps    No  I'm sorry  I forgot to include I'm not sure if you're including  like Amazon delivery  If Amazon is one of concerned one of these third party delivery  in which case I had to go ahead     Yes   No     Yes




F. Yep   I've got a  so I'm a licensed foster parent  And I've got a kid in my house who is almost 18  She's been living with me for almost a year now she was originally a friend of my  my teenage daughters  but and she's got these apps on her phone  or at least  she uses DoorDash  Mostly  but and  and despite clear guidelines that she needs to clear it with us before she you know  cuz she has a job and she earns money  but she she keeps ordering DoorDash  Like  even though we have food in the house  and like she can't  she can't stop  So that's like the personal connection to that app  But but I've also heard about  you know  I've got providers that I work with  and and  you know  friends and family who talked about  you know  their their own use of the apps by get their their kids use of the apps even when they don't want them to  etc  So yeah  I'm pretty familiar with them   I have not  no 



G. Yes   No 



H. Yes    No 







Q29  What are your opinions about third party alcohol delivery apps   Do you think there is enough regulation of these alcohol delivery apps 




A. I don t think there s enough law enforcement or enough rules for someone to hold the third party delivery accountable  Yeah   I have grave concerns about that   You know  even though they are supposed to make sure that they re delivering to someone over the age of 21  is that actually being done   Is it being recorded   Where s the accountability  It's very loose   I don t think alcohol should be delivered 



B. No  there's not enough regulation  no  Well  uh  you know  you absolutely can have as many regulations as you can  There's you know  I I really  truthfully believe that there's when you're including his third party that  are  you know  while you have those regulations and I'm not really sure how they put them into action  I haven't really experienced buying alcohol from some of these third sellers  but  I have been in in the presence or an experience  Love by an alcohol either at a restaurant or the store  and so I can see definitely the difference between a third party that is delivering to you versus you know attaining that alcohol at an establishment  And so I do believe that there's differences in that the third party one might  I don't believe it lends itself to to have these regulations be kind of acted upon in a in a way that we it's secure   And and we do make and it kind of helps you make sure it feels you  It makes you feel like these regulations are being  you know  correctly acted upon  




C.



D. I do not think so



E.  And so now I'm talking more about an app  Specific more to this what that means If I will state law as opposed to a national app 
right  Um  my my interpretation of the HB  you know  of the bill was that they couldn't order cocktails to go on third party deliveries  but that they could order  Like bottles of wine and cans of beer  Am I something that is sealed like that  Am I incorrect  Like DoorDash and whatnot  I didn't think that they could do cocktails to go  No  So restaurants can like an Uber Eats  for example  restaurant can deliver these alcohol  the taco cocktails through their delivery app     Right  I knew that the store the like the location itself could do delivery  But I didn't realize that the third party delivery like Uber Eats or those third party delivery services could  And when I see by the store  I mean  the licensee like the somebody orders from a restaurant and they happen to have a delivery driver on staff that that staff could deliver it  But I didn't think the third party delivery service could  As far as I'm aware that they can  Okay  they have been  Yeah  I know they have been  I just didn't think that it was  I remember having this being a really intense conversation during the LCB rulemaking period   No 




F. Well  here's the problem  Any regulation you have not just for this app  but but a lot of things in general  the enforcement of that regulation  or the enforceability of that regulation varies greatly  depending on the population density  So in an urban environment  it's it's much easier to in some cases  I won't say all cases  but it's much easier to put the kind of manpower and scrutiny on that on the enforcement of that app  to ensure that it's being done to maximum effectiveness  But when you go to a rural area  again  it's much more likely that that that scrutiny fades away to very little are nothing  And the policy becomes meaningless  because enforcement goes away  So  you know  like  saying that the policy is sufficient or insufficient or needs to change  It's a whole different conversation when you're looking at our population density 



G. I feel like I can't really answer since I've never experienced I've never tried ordering alcohol through one of those apps  I and I'm not familiar with what the requirements are in terms of the limitations



H. Probably not  Well  I I think that  There's a  there's a lot of room for inconsistency since there's so many different businesses  And individuals that are fulfilling roles  And and so I would just ask the questions about who and you know I'm just  Of course  making these statements  Without knowing what the current structure is internally  but about accountability  who is accountable  For any potential inconsistencies and who is monitoring it    










Q30  Do you think the third party alcohol delivery apps impact specific communities of people over others   For example  youth  elderly  rural vs  urban  etc 



A. No  I don t think impacts specific communities 



B.   This this question I I don't have enough information on and I don't have enough of a thought around it  so I say I I don't know I don't know and I don't have any thoughts on it  (OK  would you like us to have you skip this question )  Yes  yes  I'll skip that one  



C.



D. I do think it is possible  Probably us because of someone what I mentioned earlier is their ability to divert  Yeah  I think that there are some and kind of  theoretically  I think there's gotta be  if it's going to continue  I would want to figure out what some of those ways are  I think  some of the pieces around     how do we work on enforcement  How do we make sure enforcement  Is there is enough of it  Do we ask for scan of IDs  How is that tracked  How are we monitoring third party and direct delivery  So I think there could be much heavier monitoring that might help protect the diversion  you know  and so therefore  protecting youth  And I think there would need to be enforcement and resources for that enforcement and then quite frankly  follow through on whatever that is  So



E. For example  us  rural urban  right  I think that use would probably be the biggest impact with this one 



F.  
Um  possibly  I haven't done too much thinking about it  because I was kind of hoping they're gonna go away  You know  it's  it's possible that there's a way to do some deep dives and some qualitative analysis to try to figure out with  with the implementers of these applications  I would say probably like before  like  maybe something like responsible server training required for for drivers  That's one idea that I had kind of thought about  you know  so that so that the drivers understand that they're not just through picking up and dropping off there  but they are actually in that moment  they are a bartender  and they need to treat it with the same level of respect that bartenders do bartenders take their job very seriously  And they do a really good job of keeping their their spaces minor free  For the most part  There's always exceptions but  but even rural places  the bars are Pretty  pretty safe  So if if drivers could be trained at that same level and take it with that level of seriousness  and and it wasn't just available for any driver to pick up and drop off  but but only drivers who have reached a certain level of certification and professionalism  then possibly  but I don't really know  I don't know if that would make a difference 



G. would think that it could be an issue with you the access Yes  so yes  definitely Yes     Um  again  not knowing exactly what the protections are I know that  you know  you've mentioned that they have to have a signature  So  you know you I assume that that there is a protection there  And that is I did have no idea what compliance efforts might be by LCB  making sure that that happens  I  you know  so I don't have a lot of so the effectiveness of how they're  that's working 



H. Yes   Yeah  I think that the again the potential for this impacting the youth is is certainly there  So that would be the  you know  the group that I would be concerned about   Delivery apps well I think it  Would be about ensuring accountability  And the and that there is an enforcement mechanism that is  you know  an active enforcement mechanism towards those businesses  not towards the youth  








Q31  Do you think there are positive aspects associated with alcohol delivery 



A. No 



B. No  not at all  



C.



D. No 



E. No



F. No  actually



G. I can see benefits for people who can't leave their homes or it  it keeps a people who are drinking alcohol off the roads 



H. Sure  you know I I'm a member of a wine club  They deliver  You know several bottles of wine every few months  so yeah  I you know  I mean  I can see it being a very positive things in some ways  but  Also  I guess the concern about you know  The most  You know the smaller quantities the what might be appealing to a younger population  Youth in particular under 21  And finding ways to  You know utilize this structure 







Q32  Do you think there are negative aspects associated with alcohol delivery 




A. A  It just makes it easier for people to consume alcohol and I cannot think of a positive impact of that 



B.



C.



D. The one thing I haven't said is I think it's possible that   I think it's possible for overconsumption with the adults  because maybe  
people will just unexplained this  So it's like  oh  we ran out  just get some more delivered  as opposed to like  okay  maybe that's a sign that we've drank everything we should drink  And so I think overconsumption is a possibility  And there's nothing built into the delivery regulations that have like  delivery  Super Training  like when you're in an establishment so that there isn't over service that happens 




E.



F. Yep  And I do not have to elaborate
